A simple homework assignment involving Kernal Density Estimate.
Kernal Density Estimation is a way to smooth out data through the use of a probability density function using a finite amount of data.
This helps data scientists to understand the values from a T-Test in the context of hypothesis testing even when the data gathered seems to have a large standard deviation value.
